There are just too many
times that people
have tried to look
inside of me
wondering what
I think of you
and I protect you out
of courtesy
too many times that I've
Held on when
I needed to push away
afraid to say
what was on my mind
afraid to say
what I need to say
too many
Things that you've
said about me
when I'm not around
you think having
the upper hand
means you've got to
keep putting me down
but I've had too many
stand-offs with you
It's about as much as
I can stand
just wait until the
upper hand is mine
One minute you're on top
the next you're not
watch it drop
making your heart stop
just before you hit the floor
One minute you're on top
the next you're not
missed your shot
making your heart stop
you think you won
and then It's all gone
so many people like me
put so much
trust in all your lies
so concerned
with what you think
to just say
what we feel inside
so many people like me
walk on eggshells
all day long
all I know is that all I want
is to feel like
I'm not stepped on
There are so many
things you say
that make me feel like
you've crossed the line
what goes up will surely fall
and I'm counting
down the time
'cause I've had so many
stand-offs with you
It's about as much as
I can stand
so I'm waiting until
the upper hand is mine
One minute you're on top
the next you're not
watch it drop
making your heart stop
just before you hit the floor
One minute you're on top
the next you're not
missed your shot
making your heart stop
you think you won
and then It's all gone
and then It's all gone
and then It's all gone
and then It's all gone
I know I'll never trust
a single thing you say
you knew your
lies would divide us
but you lied anyway
and all the lies
have got you floating
up above us all
but what goes up
has got to fall
One minute you're on top
the next you're not
watch it drop
making your heart stop
just before you hit the floor
One minute you're on top
the next you're not
missed your shot
making your heart stop
you think you won
and then It's all gone
and then It's all gone
and then It's all gone
and then It's all gone
It's all gone
